<h1><u>Introduction to building Drones/UAVs</u></h1>

<div Style="text-align:center" >

</div>


<div class="intro">

	<p>Building a quadcopter is not rocket science. However, before we build it, it is recommended to have<br>
	an understanding of how copters work. </p>

</div>

<div class="work">

<h2><u>How does properllers work?</u></h2>


<br>

<p>Image 1.1 -Propellers in motion</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/props.jpg" alt="props">
</div>


<p>As you can see from Image 1.1 two of the propellers spin clockwise and two spin counter-clockwise.<br>
This makes sure that the two forces cancel out making the drone fly. If all of the propellers where to <br>
spin in the same direction then the drone wouldn't be able to fly but otherwise spin in the <br>
direction that the propellers move.</p>

<hr>
<h2><u>What is a flight controller?</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.2 -Flight Controller Functionality</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/pixhawk.jpg" alt="pixhawk">
</div>

<p>There are many different types of flight controllers. However, in Image 1.2 we are looking at the Pixhawk<br>
flight controller since is the most popular one. Another reason why I chose the Pixhawk was because it <br>
communicates to my Rasberry PI and I can can control it using the python programming language.</p>

<br>
<p>The way that a flight controller works is that the propeller motors are connected to it and all the different<br>
sensors such as GPS, Compass, Telemetry etc. The flight controller is encharge of controlling how fast the <br>
the propeller motors rotate and by doing so, it controls the altitude, direction, location etc.</p>

<h2><u>LIPO Batteries</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.3 -LIPO Batteries</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/lipo.jpg" alt="lipo">
</div>

<p>LIPO batteries are an essensial component of quadcopters since they provide power to it. There is a wide variety <br>
when it comes to LIPO batteries to choose from. Therefore, choosing the right one for your quadcopter is crucial<br>
to having a successful build.</p>

<p>LIPO batteries are chose based on multiple factors. The C-rating and the capacity(mAh) are some of those factors.<br>
The maximum amount of power that a battery can provide is found by multiplying the C-rating by the capacity.<br>
Let's supposed that we have a 30c, 2200mAh battery, then 30x2.2 = 66Amps which means that the maximun amount<br>
of power is 66Amps. Also, the highest the C-rating and the capacity the heavier the battery.<br>
The highest the capacity(mAh) the longest the battery lasts in the air. The bigger the C-rating, the biggest<br>
the amount of power that the battery releases. This is very dangerous since some components don't support<br>
high C-rating and as a result they burn or don't use it. That's why when choosing a battery is good to find out the<br> amount of power that the propeller motors support. Supposed that a motor supports 12v then 12x4 = 48v, this is the<br> amount of power that all the motors support. Lets also supposed that the LIPO battery is 2200mAh or 2.2. Then, <br> 48/2.2 = 21.8 or 22, this means that biggest C-rating to be chosen is 20c since choosing a bigger will not matter to the motors.</p>

<h2><u>Quadcopters Frames</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.4 -Quadcopter Frames</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/frame.jpg" alt="frame" >
</div>

<p>There are many different types of drone frames including Quadcopter, Tricopter, Optocopter etc. <br>
Also, there are many types of materials to choose from such as Carbon fiber, plastic, metal etc. <br>
However, if you want a reliable drone then I would highly suggest choosing a Carbon fiber one.</p>

<p>Keep also in mind the amount of componets and the propeller size when buying frames. <br>
There are many kits that you can buy such as the one shown in image 1.4. It includes a quadcopter<br>
frame, 4 x motors, 4 x ESC and 4 useless propellers. I mean useless because usually the ones<br>
that come in kits are not level, hence the drone is almost impossible to fly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><u>Propeller Motors</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.4 -Propeller Motors</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/motor.jpg" alt="motor" >
</div>

<p>Motors are categorize based on the numbers that they provide. if you have a motor like the one<br>
shown in image 1.4 Emax MT2204-2300KV then the first numbers or 22 means the diameter in millimiters of <br>
of the motor. The second two numbers or the 04 means that the motor is 4 millimiters tall. This is important<br>
because the bigger the diameter and height of the motor the bigger the pull and power.<br>
The Emax MT2204-2300KV is capable of using 5-inch and 6-inch props and lifting a Go-Pro with many other components.<br
></p>
<p>Another thing to pay attention to is the kv value such the one in image 1.4 or 2300kv which tells us how fast the <br>
motor's propeller rotates. </p>

<h2><u>Power Distribution Board</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.5 -Power Distribution Board</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/powerD.jpg" alt="powerD">
</div>

<p>The power distribution board does as the name suggests. It distributes power from the LIPO battery to all<br>
the other components.</p>

<h2><u>Radio Transmitters</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.4 -Radio Transmitter</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/radio.jpg" alt="radio" >
</div>


<p>The radio transmitter comes with a reciever that is connected to the drone which communicates<br>
with the flight controller and radio transmitter. The user can use a radio transmitter to send signals<br>
to the flight control which them commands the motors.</p>

<p> A radio transmitter is not require since I will using rasberry PI and Python but is a good<br>
thing to have just in case the drone decides not to obey our python commands</p>

<h2><u>Rasberry PI</u></h2>
<br>
<p>Image 1.4 -Rasberry PI 3</p>

<div Style="text-align:center" >
  <img src="images/rasberry.jpg" alt="rasberryPI">
</div>


<p>Rasberry PI is one of the most popular mini computers that have ever existed. People are using<br>
this mini motherboard to perform all kinds of tasks. From building a media center, to hosting <br>
your personal owncloud account to robotics. This board is cheap and powerful and we can use python<br>
which comes in handy since many people in the research world are using python. It also can <br>
communicate to the Pixhawk which is great since we can control and automate anything<br>
that we want our quadcopter to do.</p>
